Group 1 Final Project repository 

#Each branch contains different parts of the final project for the 2011 MS River flooding event.

#In the Upper-Air branch, the Python file plots an upper air chart for 4/22/2011 (relative humidity/geopotential height). The resulting plot is in a separate file within the branch.

#In the sfc-maps branch, the two Python files plot surface charts for 4/22/2011 and 4/23/2011, respectively, each with total precipitation amounts. The resulting plots are in separate files within the branch. 

#In the sounding branch, the Python file retrieves sounding data for 4/23/2011 at 7am from the Springfield, Missouri station. The resulting plot is a separate file within the branch. 

#In the meteogram branch, the Python file creates a plot showing the MS river's height change over time. The resulting plot is a separate file within the branch.
