#These Python files can be used to examine different meteorological/hydrological charts for the MS River Flooding of 2011.

#In the 20110422_sounding.py file, data is pulled from the University of Wyoming remote server to plot a sounding for Springfield, MO on April 23rd, 2011.

#In the finalproject_meteogram.py file, data from two different text files is plotted to depict the MS River stream flow changes after the flooding effects.

#In the finalproject_upperair.py file, data is pulled from a GFS grb file to depict the upper air geopotential heights and relative humidity contours on April 22nd, 2011.

#In the prcp_sfc04_22.py file, data is pulled from a GFS model grb file to create a surface map for forecasted precipitation amounts on April 22rd, 2011.

#Similarly, in the prcp_sfc_23map.py file, data is pulled from a different GFS model grb file to create a surface map for forecasted precipitation amounts on April 23rd, 2011.
